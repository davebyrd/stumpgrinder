### The DataOracle class reads real historical trade data (not price or quote)
### from a given date in history to be resimulated.  It stores these trades
### in a time-sorted array at maximum resolution.  It can be called by
### certain "background" agents to obtain noisy observations about the "real"
### price of a stock at a current time.  It is intended to provide some realistic
### behavior and "price gravity" to the simulated market -- i.e. to make the
### market behave something like reality in the absence of whatever experiment
### we are running with more active agent types.
